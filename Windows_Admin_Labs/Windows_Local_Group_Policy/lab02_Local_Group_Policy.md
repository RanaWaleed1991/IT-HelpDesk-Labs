# ðŸ§ª Windows Administration Lab: Local Group Policy for Security

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to **secure a Windows 10 endpoint using Local Group Policy** by enforcing password complexity requirements and disabling USB storage devices. These are essential steps in hardening a system to prevent weak credentials and unauthorized data access.

## Steps and Screenshots

### Step 1: Access the Local Group Policy Editor
1. Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press **Enter**.  
2. This opens the **Local Group Policy Editor** where security settings can be managed.

### Step 2: Enforce Password Complexity
1. Navigate to:  
Computer Configuration â†’ Windows Settings â†’ Security Settings â†’ Account Policies â†’ Password Policy

2. Enable **Password must meet complexity requirements**.  
3. Set **Minimum Password Length** to **8 characters**.  
4. Apply changes.

### Step 3: Disable USB Storage Devices
1. Navigate to:  
Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ System â†’ Removable Storage Access

2. Enable **All Removable Storage classes: Deny all access**.  
3. Apply changes.

### Step 4: Verify the Policy
1. Run the following in **Command Prompt** to apply policies immediately:  
gpupdate /force

2. Test **password policy**: Try setting a weak password â†’ it should fail.  
3. Test **USB policy**: Insert a USB drive â†’ access should be denied.

## Conclusion
This lab successfully demonstrated how to:  
- Enforce **password complexity** and minimum length requirements for stronger authentication.  
- Disable **USB storage devices** to prevent unauthorized data access.  
- Verify applied policies to ensure endpoint security hardening is effective.  

Configuring **local security policies** is a critical skill for Help Desk and Junior SysAdmin roles.
